# liri-node-app

Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a README.md file.

In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the README.md file should meet the following criteria:


Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
Clearly list the technologies used in the app
State your role in the app development


Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
